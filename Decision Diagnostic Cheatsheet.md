# Decision Diagnostic Cheatsheet (10 minutes)

This is a quick way to apply the diagnostic when facing a confusing debate,
expert disagreement, or unstable policy decision.

---

## Step 1 — Identify the apparent question

What is the issue being discussed?

---

## Step 2 — Check for Frame Mismatch

Ask:
- Is this being treated as a prediction problem?
- Or is this actually about structural change in a system?

If different participants are answering different types, note it.

---

## Step 3 — Check the Layers

For key arguments, label them:

- Natural: something humans can only respond to
- Structural: an arrangement shaping responses
- Moral: an interpretation of what should happen

Look for mixing between these.

---

## Step 4 — Rephrase the issue

Rewrite the problem separating:
- what cannot be negotiated
- what can be designed
- what is interpretive

---

## Step 5 — Identify what to investigate next

Instead of asking “who is right?”, ask:
- which frame is appropriate?
- which layer the issue actually belongs to?

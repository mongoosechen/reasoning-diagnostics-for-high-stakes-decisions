# Frame Mismatch & Responsibility Layer Diagnostic

This diagnostic helps identify a common pattern in high-stakes debates and decisions:

> Smart people reasoning carefully inside a misframed problem.

It focuses on two recurring sources of confusion:
- treating structural problems as prediction problems
- mixing different layers of causality without noticing

---

## Part 1 — Frame Mismatch

Many disagreements occur because participants are solving different types of problems without realising it.

There are two common ways people simplify complex reality to make decisions:

### Time Framing — Predicting outcomes

Typical questions:
- What will happen if we do X?
- How likely is outcome Y?
- What is the timeline of risk?

This framing works when the main uncertainty is about **future events**.

---

### Structural Framing — Understanding system change

Typical questions:
- How does X change relationships within the system?
- What new patterns become possible?
- How does responsibility or agency shift?

This framing works when the issue is about **changes in how the system behaves**, not predicting events.

---

### What goes wrong

Debates often stall because:
- one side is answering a time-framed question
- the other side is answering a structural-framed question

Both may be reasoning correctly, but about different problem types.

This makes disagreements persistent and hard to resolve.

## Part 2 — Layer Confusion

Many debates mix different layers of causality without noticing.

These layers are not about behaviour or policy.  
They are about **different causal statuses**.

You can distinguish them with a simple test.

---

### Natural Layer — What humans can only respond to

This is the layer of conditions that exist independently of interpretation, judgment, or design.

**Test:**  
Can humans negotiate with this, or can they only respond to it?

If they can only respond, it belongs to the natural layer.

Examples:
- A capability exists
- Information can be produced or copied
- A tool works as designed
- A causal possibility is present

Moral judgment does not change this.  
Structural design does not remove this.  
Humans can only decide how to respond.

---

### Structural Layer — How humans arrange their response

This is where humans design systems to shape how they respond to the natural layer.

**Test:**  
Is this an arrangement intended to influence how people respond to what already exists?

Examples:
- Laws and regulations
- Platform architecture
- Governance mechanisms
- Organisational rules

This layer is negotiable and designable.

---

### Moral Layer — How humans interpret what happened

This is the layer of evaluation after responses occur.

**Test:**  
Is this describing how things should be, rather than how they unfold?

Examples:
- Ethical expectations
- Judgments of responsibility
- Norms and professional standards

This layer does not change causality.  
It interprets it.

---

## What goes wrong

Confusion happens when:

- The natural layer is treated as if it can be negotiated through moral language
- Moral expectations are used to try to change natural conditions
- Structural solutions are expected to remove what belongs to the natural layer

This leads to debates and policies that feel reasonable but fail in practice.

---

## Using the diagnostic

When facing a difficult disagreement or unstable decision, check:

1. Are participants framing this as different types of problems (time vs structural)?
2. Are natural, structural, and moral layers being mixed without clarity?
3. Would this disagreement still remain even if the framing were clarified?

If yes, the issue is likely misframed rather than poorly analysed.
